# nAb-SpikeProtein_MassBalance

Context for project: PNAS paper suggests that for an innate clearance of COVID-19 infection, the number of neutralizing antibodies must approach or surpass the number of active viral molecules present with the human body. PNAS suggests in order for a complete resolution of Sx, there is a ratio of 1000-100,000 antibody:spike protein. 
• only 5% of endogenous antibodies targeted for spike protein are effective in viral clearance; PNAS suggests the immune system conquers this viral infection by sheer quantity of Ab. 
• ~ 30 spike trimers on each virion (Sender, et. al, PNAS) 

If this disparity between number of antibodies to spike protein is true, then we should observe a similar ratio in monoclonal_Abx:spike protein, which implies that the number of Ab molecules >>>>> # spike protein 
Per results from clinical trials for EUA-monoclonal antibodies, there doesn't seem to be high enough concentration of therapy, or there is an observed lessened amount of Abx:SPIKE PROTEIN, not Abx:viron count. In order to explain the resolution of Sx, there must be an undiscovered additional MoA from these antibodies (which can explain resolution of Sx), or the dosing of the aforementioned mAb therapy is lower than optimal and can be improved to reduce treatment duration.
