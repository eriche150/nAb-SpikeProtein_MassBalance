# nAb-SpikeProtein_MassBalance
Project: The evaluation of dosing for immunotherapies indicated for SARS-CoV-2 infection through mass balance analysis 

#Background
Literature suggests that for an innate clearance of COVID-19 infection, the number of neutralizing antibodies must greatly exceed the number of active viral molecules present with the human body. Convalescent serum taken from patients three-weeks after complete resolution of Sx reveals there is a ratio of 1000-100,000 antibody:spike protein, and only 5% of endogenous antibodies produced specifically for spike protein are capable of neutralization. (https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.57264) 

##Model Structure



If this disparity between number of antibodies to spike protein is true, then we should observe a similar ratio in monoclonal_Abx:spike protein, which implies that the number of Ab molecules >>>>> # spike protein 
Per results from clinical trials for EUA-monoclonal antibodies, there doesn't seem to be high enough concentration of therapy, or there is an observed lessened amount of Abx:SPIKE PROTEIN, not Abx:viron count. In order to explain the resolution of Sx, there must be an undiscovered additional MoA from these antibodies (which can explain resolution of Sx), or the dosing of the aforementioned mAb therapy is lower than optimal and can be improved to reduce treatment duration.
